# hcde-410-final

These files are for my HCDE 410 final project at the University of Washington. This notebook will look through data about public schools in the US on their technology usage before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. I will be using two reports from the Institute of Education Sciences from the respective years they are reporting on. 

The two sources are:
- Teachers’ Use of Educational Technology in U.S. Public Schools: 2009
- Use of Educational Technology for Instruction in Public Schools: 2019—20

Each file is labeled per the assignment instuctions and such have nuanced titles. Here I will depict what each file contains:

- <bold>A4:</bold> This file is the first of the final project assignments as a preliminary proposal. Here I write my problem statement and motivations for such a project. I also include the datasets I plan on using, which may change as I tweak my actual analysis goal. Lastly, I write the unknowns and dependencies I have and what is out of my control that will possibly effect my completion of this final assignment and research study.
