## Educational Technology in Ten Years

This notebook is for my HCDE 410: Human Data Interaction final project at the University of Washington. This notebook will look through technology data from the public schools in the United States from 2009 and 2019-20 school years. I will be using two reports from the Institute of Education Sciences from the respective years they are reporting on. 

The two sources are:
- [Teachers’ Use of Educational Technology in U.S. Public Schools: 2009](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2010/2010040.pdf)
- [Use of Educational Technology for Instruction in Public Schools: 2019—20](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2021/2021017.pdf)

Here is what you will find in the notebook:
- <bold>Analysis.ipynb:</bold> this file holds all code, findings, and parts of the discussion that came from the actual analysis of the datasets. I wrote Markdown cells inbetween the code cells to explain the code and what the analysises showed because it made more sense to put that in the same location as the results. This holds raw code and findings, the overview of Findings and Discussion will be found in ``Overview.ipynb``
- ``Comparison of Technology Used in 2009 vs 2019.png``: this is a photo of my results from the comparison of technology between 2009 and 2019-20 school years.
- ``Distribution of Computer Use in Schools 2019-20.png``: this is a photo of the addtional visualizations I created of just 2019-20 data that shows the kind of technology access elementary, middle and high schools give their students 
- <bold>LICENSE:</bold> this file hold the license of my work
- <bold>Overview.ipynb:</bold> This file is entire report overview, starting with the Motivation and ending with the Findings, Discussion, and Conlusion. Writing this document was broken into a couple different assignments for the class:
  - A4: preliminary proposal (including the Motivation, Problem Statement, Data selected for analysis, and the Unknowns and Dependencies)
  - A5: final proposal (including A4 material, Overview, Research Questions (or hypotheses), Background and/or Related Work, and Methodology)
  - A7: final project report (including Introduction, Background or Related Work, Research questions or hypotheses, Methodology, Findings, Discussion (including Limitations and Implications), Conclusion, and References (optional))
- ``Ratio of Students to Computers in Schools 2009 vs 2019.png``: this is the results I got in the comparison between all pubic school students to computer ratio
- ``Student to Computer Ratio.pdf``: this is the better visualization I created using Figma to show the ratio found in the above graphic. I thought it was easier for people to see the biggest difference and finding in this analysis with a better graphic then I could code in the notebook.
- ``Top Five Software and Internet Sites.png``: this is a photo of the results back from the top five software and internet sites used in 2009 by students and teachers
