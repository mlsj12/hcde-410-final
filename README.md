# hcde-410-final

These files are for my HCDE 410 final project at the University of Washington. This notebook will look through data about public schools in the US on their technology usage before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. I will be using two reports from the Institute of Education Sciences from the respective years they are reporting on. 

The two sources are:
- Teachers’ Use of Educational Technology in U.S. Public Schools: 2009
- Use of Educational Technology for Instruction in Public Schools: 2019—20

Each file is labeled per the assignment instuctions and such have nuanced titles. Here I will depict what each file contains:

- <bold>A4+A5:</bold> This file is the first and second part of the final project assignment. A4 was the preliminary proposal while A5 is the final proposal. Here I write the overview of my project, the data I will use, the background and related work, unknowns and dependencies that may effect the completion of the project, and my methodology.
